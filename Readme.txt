All scripts are written in Python and can be run from command line as python namescript.py if not stated otherwise in script's header or from python interpreter of your choice.

Scripts are product of my learning and exploration process of network programming with python and many ideas were borrowed from books, tutorials and other sources with some of my reworkings and additions.
